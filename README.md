Implemented the Queue-reactive model in python to simulate a real orderbook to predict probability of execution for high frequency trading (hft) algorithms.

# Features
- Capable of processing 100,000 orders a second using a fast Limit Orderbook Implementation utilizing AVL Trees
- Parses real world data provided by LOBSTER Data to replicate real world order intensities.
- Vectorized all data computations to run in near-instant time utilizing Dynamic Programming to cache frequent access results
